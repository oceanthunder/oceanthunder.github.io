			100% of the people that are born, die.
			<br>
			Many people experience chronic loneliness throughout their lives.
			<br>
			Elephants mourn their dead and hold funerals.
			<br>
			Laika died alone in space.

			"Sadness is a part of life", said Joe.
			<br>
			"Fuck Joe", said the scientist and kept working on a thing that he belived would nudge society in a
			slightly better direction.
			<br>
			Joe couldn't bear such humiliation and in retaliation he killed the scientist, a bloody termination.
			He was arrested shortly after and served a sentence in prison for life.

			Anyway, I'm Ocean Thunder, you can call me O.T. (pronounced otea).
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm currently delighting my ears with some <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Us_Cracks">
			Us Cracks</a>. Really like the subtle nature of their songs.. weaving the threads between the absurdity
			of life and corporate enshittification.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm listening to them through a cable that runs from my Thinkpad(more on that later) to.. well, you 
			know where(duh?). They are some pretty good monitors(as in IEMs). Went through my audiophile phase
			through some communities, without buying anything, and then finally after the phase and the awe was 
			over, bought myself the most budget friendly ones.. specifically the Moondrop Chu II. WRP fs!!
			<br>
			<br>
			The Thinkpad is a marvel of engineering, something that can only be achieved by sacrificing a thousand
			axolotls on a windy day at mount moon after traversing through the multiverse at 8:21 military time
			beyond the central finite curve of existence. And then too, we'll only have a 1% chance of recreating
			this magnificent beast, atom by atom. 
			<br>
			<br>
			For my operating system I use the humble Arch Linux, it's quiet(as in it gets out of my way completely)				. Also, I use a tiling window manager for my GUI needs, i3wm. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This site was made mostly in neovim. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Eating eggs is kind of like abortion.
			<br>
			<br>
			Ok, if I got anything else on my mind, will update. Bi bye
