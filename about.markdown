# **Hi, I'm Sahil Garje**

I’m a human who learns about rocks—rocks that have done some crazy things, like mapping the human genome, creating virtual worlds, and putting a man on the f*cking moon. And no, this isn’t about a Dwayne Johnson cameo; I’m obviously talking about computers.  

### School

I also have done some schooling and I learned a lot there, like schools don't teach jacksh\*t. (or maybe they do, since it's all jacksh\*t)

My college life (which happens to be my current life) is filled with ambitions—getting that BTech degree as soon as possible is definitely at the top of the list!

### Goals

Do I have any goals, you ask? Yeah, like making neptune a planet and switching the world leadeers with chimpanzees, I got a lot of goals, I say smirkingly.

### Interests

I... whatever, I don't even like living.
