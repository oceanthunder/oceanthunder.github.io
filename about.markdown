# **Hi, I'm Sahil Garje**  

I’m a human who learns about rocks—rocks that have done some crazy things, like mapping the human genome, creating virtual worlds, and putting a man on the [censored words are strong and this feat of humanity requires such mighty words, but it's an about section which is supposed to be formal, so imagine any taboo word here] MOON! And no, this isn’t about a Dwayne Johnson cameo; I’m obviously talking about computers.  

### School  

I also have done some schooling and learned a lot there, like how schools don't teach jacks... I got interested in science and arts [although I’m not sure if it was anime or school, most probably anime, but still], so schools ain't that bad.  

My college life (which happens to be my current life) is filled with ambitions, sleep deprivation, and a little depression, but who cares! I get to write these papers and create random shower-thought projects, so college is also not bad.  

### Goals  

Do I have any goals, you ask? Yeah, like making Neptune a planet again and switching the world leaders with chimpanzees—I got a lot of goals, I say smirkingly.  

### Interests  

I like to exist and think and see the world [prospering or otherwise].
