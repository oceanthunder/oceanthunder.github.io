			<p>
			only when the nights are the darkest and when the air is filled with terror does BIGpaaji appear.
			<br>
			he has snakes growing out of his chest (some say they are hair, but that's a stupid hypothesis since
			he shaves every single day) and he wears suspenders becuase he always forgets the damned leg day.
			<br>
			this time he came to protect the traditional race between the tortoise and the rabbit, on a starry
			night.

			[p.s. this pic is mit license so you can use it freely but don't remove the mit tag because if you do,
			BIGpaaji would be upset! (he likes everything mit)]

			<h2>bongozaki: the departure</h2>
			<img src="assets/doodles/bongo.jpeg">
			</a>
			<p>
			bongo cat just got thrown out of the plane by miyazaki!
			<br>
			but can you blame miyazaki for that?? i mean he was going on a war against the bongos and he didn't 
			want the bongo cat to see the destruction of bongopia...
			<br>
			with a heavy heart miyazaki departs, the sunset signifying this depressing departure towards a new
			future without the bongs and bongers, and the clouds vibing to the last of the bongos.
