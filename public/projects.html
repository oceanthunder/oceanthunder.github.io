			<p>
			Have you ever felt alone in the world of Minecraft?
			<br>
			Have you ever wondered what it's like to have a person join your virtual world?
			<br>
			Have you ever wanted to show off your minecraft creations to anyone other than random strangers on 
			the internet?
			<br>
			<br>
			Well, this project doesn't solve any of that. It's a minecraft bot, just a few lines of code
			that is cool to show off to friends (only works if you have them).

			<h2>The Text Monger</h2>
			<a href="https://pypi.org/project/textmonger/">
			<img src="assets/monger.png">
			</a>
			<p>
			This does some pseudo text-analysis on text like readability scoring (the reading grade)
			, power words distribution (types of words used; angry/encouraging/lustful etc etc),
			sentiment analysis (polarity and subjectivity of text),
			and named entity recognition (location/person/number/etc).
			<br>
			<br>
			Not really proud of this project, but it was the first proper 'academic' project, still it's meh.
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			You can install it using 'pip install textmonger'.

			<h2>Ponpon Shit: An Edgerunner's Summary</h2>
			<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/931259605/">
			<img src="assets/ponpon.png">
			</a>
			<p>
			I absolutely ADORE cyberpunk!
			<br>
			This thing basically summarizes the anime <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/edgerunners">
			Cyberpunk Edgerunners</a>, the way a drunkard that recently had his third divorce due to his inherent 
			nihilistic way of thinking towards relationships would.
			<br>
			I had to condense the whole 'animation' to around 3 minutes (the length of Ponpon Shit), which was 
			getting a bit frustrating but still I got to listen to that song multiple times, which was nice.
			<br>
			This took me around 2 months to make, and I don't remember being too bored,exhausted, or wanting to 
			kill myself while working on it. 10/10 would do it again if i get resurrectd.
